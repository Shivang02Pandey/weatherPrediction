# weatherPrediction
This project aims to develop a predictive model for weather patterns using ridge linear regression. By leveraging historical weather data, the study focuses on identifying key factors influencing weather conditions. Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training are conducted to optimize the model's performance. The effectiveness of the ridge regression model is evaluated using relevant metrics, and insights derived from the model contribute to a deeper understanding of weather patterns.
